# Coding Challenge “Passionate Navigation”

# Instructions

```
npm install // (OR yarn install)
npm run dev // (OR yarn run dev)
```

# Explanation

This is a course selection tool that allows the user to first select verticals and then categories, then shows the related courses. It is designed for an on-boarding type usecase and is similar to what applications like Twitter present upon registration.

It uses the new [`react-final-form`](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form) library from Erik Rassmusen. I've also set up [`flow`](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed) on the project. It's my first project experimenting with [`next`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) as well.
